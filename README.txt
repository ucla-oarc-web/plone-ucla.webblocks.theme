INTRODUCTION
============

WebBlocks is a toolkit for building full-featured, responsive sites. Beyond it's library of structural components, interface elements and Javascript libraries, it is also highly configurable, modular and extensible. To achieve this, it is built around a compiler that leverages Compass/SASS and other Ruby and Node.js tools. Unfortunately, this can prove alienating to some developers and designers.

WebBlocks Plone Theme is a Plone theme integrated with WebBlocks that was built for UCLA IT Services. It is intended to serve as a reference implementation regarding an approach to building WebBlocks-powered Plone themes.
